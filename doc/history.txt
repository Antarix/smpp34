smpp34 (and its related libraries like smpp34pdu) is a "Big ReWrite(tm)" of
an adhoc implementation of smpp34. That adhoc implementation started after
I attempted to use oserl but couldn't quite figure out how it worked.

In an attempt to upgrade my knowledge, I downloaded the SMPP 3.4 spec and
discovered it was a pretty well specified and simple protocol and I started
playing around. 1 week later I could bind, submit and get SMS delivered to me.

I ran away with that and implemented an SMPP server which worked pretty nicely
for a ad-hoc spec. A few weeks later, looking at logs of my server, I began to
notice the inevitable. I had errors that I could directly trace back to my
library implementation. I could either fix it or re-write it properly. 

A lot of the problems came from my incomplete protocol parser, the rest just
had to do with my library design and process interactions. There was no stable
core, so I decided to do it again. The first of that work is the smpp34pdu
library which handles the pure PDU packing and unpacking.

smpp34 exposes an interface which makes use of smpp34pdu to perform
smpp 3.4 communication.
