The dependencies b/w the different components should actually also guide the
monitoring and cleanup activities when the DOWN message is received, so for
instance, the PDURX should send #unbind{} if any other process dies, but if the
TcpTX dies, there's no need, since the TcpTx will already have died.


We need to implement response timeouts. For instance, after sending a PDU,
we should expect a response pdu (if the protocol defines it) in a particular
interval, after which, we should timeout and consider that request as failed.
A typical example of where the absense of this can result in a problem is during
unbind. If we initiate an unbind, we normally should wait for an unbind_resp{} 
from the SMSC before we shutdown. We should not wait for all eternity... ;)
