PDUrx needs to know its RX
PDUrx also needs to know its TXer
So we need to work out synchronisation b/w these procs

The dependencies b/w the different components should actually also guide the
monitoring and cleanup activities when the DOWN message is received, so for
instance, the PDURX should send #unbind{} if any other process dies, but if the
TcpTX dies, there's no need, since the TcpTx will already have died.
