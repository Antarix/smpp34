We need to implement response timeouts. For instance, after sending a PDU,
we should expect a response pdu (if the protocol defines it) in a particular
interval, after which, we should timeout and consider that request as failed.
A typical example of where the absense of this can result in a problem is during
unbind. If we initiate an unbind, we normally should wait for an unbind_resp{} 
from the SMSC before we shutdown RX. We should not wait for all eternity... ;)


When logging, the gen_server, gen_fsm states are usually included in the log
detail. I've noticed that if I use a the same name for all the states, then the
logs are harder to decipher, as its confusing knowing which module produced the
error. I'll need to rename the state records to reflect which the module
properly so the errors are easier to decipher
