We need to implement response timeouts. For instance, after sending a PDU,
we should expect a response pdu (if the protocol defines it) in a particular
interval, after which, we should timeout and consider that request as failed.
A typical example of where the absense of this can result in a problem is during
unbind. If we initiate an unbind, we normally should wait for an unbind_resp{} 
from the SMSC before we shutdown RX. We should not wait for all eternity... ;)


Currently, esme_core insulates its users from the lowe layer deaths. This should
change as it is a residue of the previous design where esme_core was part of the
userspace API. For now, esme_core should no more be a gen_fsm. It should be a
plain gen_server and the layers above it should be gen_fsms. It should also
cascade it's death upwards, so we don't get stuck indefinitely above.
