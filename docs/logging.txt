Introspection and logging is a very important part of any sufficiently non
trivial system.

smpp34 can probably qualify as being sufficiently non-trivial and therefore 
needs proper logging to expose what is going on internally.

The basic idea for logging in smpp34 is to be able to see what is going on,
if you want to.

The constraints are:

    1. Logging should be optional
    2. Logging should have little impact on the system
    3. Logging should be easy to interact with API-wise
